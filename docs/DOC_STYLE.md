# DOCUMENTATION STYLE

## 1. Markdown Standards
- Use clear, hierarchical headers.
- Use lists for rules and requirements.
- Escape inline backticks as \` if they appear in text that might be processed by other tools.

## 2. Tone
- Canonical documents should be authoritative and concise.
- Use "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" as per RFC 2119.
