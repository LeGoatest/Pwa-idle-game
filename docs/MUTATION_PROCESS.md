# MUTATION PROCESS

## 1. Governance Changes
- Any change to files in `docs/` or `Jules/` is considered a **Constitutional Mutation**.
- Mutations must be proposed through a formal Spec in `.jtasks/`.
- The Agent must verify that the proposed mutation does not violate the `SYSTEM_AXIOMS.md`.

## 2. Procedure
1. Create a Spec in `.jtasks/specs/` defining the mutation.
2. Review the impact on `ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`.
3. Apply the change only after the Spec is approved/finalized.
